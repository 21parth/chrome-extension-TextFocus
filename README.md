# chrome-extension-TextFocus
## Chrome extension to remove adds or unwanted content from the page.
<p>I'm just starting making Chrome extensions so I've got the basics down ✅. Right now, this only works on specific websites, and my plan is to make it more useful for other websites too.🚀
<p>I am on it. 😁</p>
<p>I will appreciate all your suggestions.🫡</p>

## How to use?
<p>Step 1: Download the <a href="https://github.com/21parth/chrome-extension-TextFocus">Zip file from here</a> and extract it.</p>
<p>Step 2: Go to 'chrome://extensions/'.</p>
<p>Step 3: Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on "Load unpacked" and select the root directory (folder).</p>
<p>Step 5: That is it you will see the extension on the board with all other extentions. Make sure you enable that by using the toggle switch.</p>
<p>Now I think you can go to the website and then just pin the extension. and just click it. And just enjoy the magic on the page... Thanks 🚀</p>
